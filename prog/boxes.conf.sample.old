### number message, type and (sometimes) password are *REQUIRED* ###
#
# Definitions of fields:
# number: the box/extension number, e.g. 023
#
# message: the file played when accessing this box
# note that this is _relative_ to the messagedir in
# voxbox.conf
#
# type: indicates the type of box.
# Acceptable values are: 'mail', 'pager', 'command' and 'none'.
#
# password: password used to login and retrieve messages.  This field
# is also REQUIRED if is_mailbox is true (mail drops need a password, 
# messages that don't accept mail do not).  Valid entries are composed
# of a series of digits or the word 'none' (only for is_mailbox = 0).
#
# owner:  which local user may read the file. Use /etc/passwd usernames.
#
# email:  if an email address is specified, the system will notify
# it when a message is recieved in the box.  The field is optional, use
# 'none' (without quotes) if you wish to add a branch field without having
# email notification.
#
# branch: comma seperated list of boxes this box branches to.  Eg:
# 000 says "press 1 for english 2 for french".  Dialing 1 brings you to
# the first box in the list while dialing 2 sends you to the second box.
# You can add many boxes in your menu, just don't put any spaces in the list
# e.g.: 012,154,011,032,055 is a valid branch (state choices 1-5 in the message)
# You may now use an X=YYY notation, where X is the key to press for box YYY.
# This lets you create branches like 012,154,9=001 so pressing 9 will lead to
# box 001.
#
# box config lines of form:
# See explanation below for details. 

########################### BOXES ###########################

# All these boxes are owned by ROOT because I don't know

########################## COMMANDS ##########################

# command set the valid entries and associated commands for 'command' type
# boxes.  command type mailboxes MUST have a password set.
#
# Command statements must be placed /after/ box creation
# because of validation.
#
# All entries must be on a single line.  For complex commands, create a script,
# chmod so that it is executable and place it in commanddir (set in the main
# conf file).
#
# The format of the lines is:
# 'command' box selection input return run
#
# All lines begin with the keyword 'command'.
#
# box is the (command type) box this statement is associated with.  The option will
# be available in this box's command shell.
#
# selection is the dtmf the user is to enter while in the command shell to run the associated
# command.
#
# input.  If you need to get user input for this command, add the type here or use 'none'.
# Valid types are 'raw' and 'text'.  'raw' input will add the exact sequence of dtmf digits
# entered at the prompt by the user to the end of the paramater list of the program to run.
# The 'text' type will take that raw input and translate it to text (e.g. '21' = 'a') -> please 
# see the documentation for more info on this.  
#
# return.  The return value read to the user: must be 'exit', 'output' or 'file'.  If 'exit', will
# read exit status of the program to user, if 'output' will read the (numerical) output to
# user, which may be multi-lined. When using the 'file' return value, the command executed is 
# expected to output one or more lines, each containing the _full path_ to a sound file
# preferably an rmd file created for your type of modem (if it is another format, the program
# will attempt to Do the Right Thing by using the rmd* settings from vocp.conf).
# 
# run: the executable to run upon selection of choice.  The path to these programs is 
# relative to the commanddir.  The (numeric) returned value will be read
# back to the user by the system.
#
#'command' box selection input	return run 

# Command shell 600:
# Selection 100 in box 600 expects TEXT input (see the docs)!
command	600	100	 text	output	ip.pl 
# Sel 150 reads you the ip of eth0
command	600	150	 none	output	ip.pl eth0
# Sel 250 reads whatever numbers you enter as input
command	600	250	 raw	output	echo


# Command shell 666:
# Selection 100 in box 666 reads you the current time
command	666	100	 none	output	date.pl
# While 200 just reads you the exit status code 
command 666	200	 none	exit	date.pl

########### EXPERIMENTAL ###############
#### FAX ON DEMAND #####################
### Fax on demand boxes allow users to call in, go through the menu and select a fax
### they wish to receive.  The advantage of fax-on-demand over faxback is that the 
### caller is responsible for dialing in and associated charges (and there's less
### risk of some 31337 phreaker causing your box to start faxing some third party).
###
### The parameters for the faxondemand boxes are:
### 'faxondemand' box fileToFax
###
### Where 'faxondemand' is a keyword indicating the type of configuration line.
### 'box' is the configured faxondemand box number
### 'fileToFax' is the file to send to the caller
###
### 'faxondemand' box fileToFax

# faxondemand 300 /usr/local/vocp/testfax.g3


#
# End of file.
