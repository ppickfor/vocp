Audio::DSP - Perl interface to *NIX digital audio device

Version 0.02 B - This version was patched by Pat Deegan for use with the
VOCP IVR system (http://www.vocpsystem.com)

Description

    Audio::DSP is built around the OSS (Open Sound System) API and allows
    perl to interface with a digital audio device. The Audio::DSP object
    stores I/O parameters and also supplies temporary storage for raw
    audio data.

Requirements

    In order to use Audio::DSP, you'll need to have the necessary OSS 
    drivers/includes installed. OSS is available for many popular Unices,
    and a GPLed version (with which this extention was developed and 
    tested) is distributed with with the Linux kernel. See "See Also"
    below for relevant URLs.

Download

    The latest version may be downloaded from the Audio::DSP homepage:
        http://www.pdamusic.com/computer/audio-dsp.html

Installation

    The usual.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (optional)
    make install

    NOTE: If for some reason the tests fail, it may be because the options
    specified in the tests are not compatible with your soundcard. I've
    used "lowest common denominator" settings (8 bit unsigned, 8 kHz 
    mono), but they may not be so "common" to your soundcard. :-) In which
    case (if you know what you're doing) you may modify or simply skip the
    tests and do what you will...

To Do / Suggestion for Data Manipulation Extentions

    In keeping with purpose, I have not included any methods for data
    manipulation in the Audio::DSP extension (the Audio::DSP object
    provides storage for raw audio data read from the device, but that is
    all). It would, however, be nice to implement a suite of modules for
    the purpose of data manipulation (converting the data to common audio
    file formats, filtering, etc.). I would suggest a sort of shared
    "audio data object," to be passed between classes, containing the raw 
    audio data as well as a few necessary paramters. A hash reference
    looking something like:

        {
            data     => 'gobbledegook',
            format   => 16,
            rate     => 44100,
            channels => 2,
        }

    would probably suffice. Let me know if this is something on which
    you'd be interested in collaborating.
