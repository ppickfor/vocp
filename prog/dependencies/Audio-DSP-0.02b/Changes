        - added several new methods:
            - Opening/closing device
                - open
            - Direct read/write to device
                - dread
                - dwrite
            - I/O Control
                - channels
                - setduplex
                - setfmt
                - speed

        - The following methods are now deprecated:
            - getformat
            - queryformat
            - setchannels
            - setdevice
            - setformat
            - setrate

        - The following sample-format constants are now exported on use:
            - AFMT_MU_LAW
            - AFMT_A_LAW
            - AFMT_IMA_ADPCM
            - AFMT_U8
            - AFMT_S16_LE
            - AFMT_S16_BE
            - AFMT_S8
            - AFMT_U16_LE
            - AFMT_U16_BE
            - AFMT_MPEG

        Consequently, the 'format' parameter in the init() method should be
        passed in constant rather than string form (string form is deprecated).
        On a similar note, the open flag should be passed as a Fcntl.pm
        constant rather than a string (also deprecated).
