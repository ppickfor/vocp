Welcome to the VOCP voice messaging system.

For the latest version and complete documentation, see the official website at:
http://www.VOCPsystem.com

Also BE SURE to have a look in the doc/ directory.

The VOCP system is a complete voice messaging solution, featuring voicemail boxes, email pagers and DTMF command shells.  Users can navigate the system using a touch-tone phone, leave and retrieve messages and execute programs on the host machine using the DTMF command shells.

VOCP now features a graphical configuration utility, a message retrieval, call center and faxing GUIs, as well as the core VOCP voice messaging system and the VOCPweb web interface.
